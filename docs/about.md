I'm an Associate Developer working on frontend and backend projects at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), where I write Javascript (React, Typescript, Node etc) and Scala.

My road into programming was meandering - I worked in digital marketing for several years after graduating with a degree in English Literature, and ended up discovering an interest for programming in my spare time. I'm fortunate to work in a great team and organisation where learning and sharing knowledge is embraced.

I'm into Python, machine learning and generative art - and live in Kent with my wonderful fianc√© Katie and our cat Walter.
