I'm an Associate Developer working on frontend and backend projects at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), where I write Javascript (React, Typescript, Node etc) and Scala.

I'm into Python, machine learning and generative art - and live in Kent with my wonderful fianc√© Katie and our cat Walter.
